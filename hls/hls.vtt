[normal_hearing] 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.900 line:98%
There are three types of hearing loss that can impact an individual:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing] 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.900 line:98%
Conductive, Sensorineural, and Mixed Hearing Loss.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.900 line:98%
Conductive Hearing Loss can be caused by

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500 line:98%
[normal_hearing] 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500 line:98%
damage to the outer or middle ear.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.500 line:98%
[normal_hearing] 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.500 line:98%
This type of hearing loss is usually moderate

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.900 line:98%
and never severe or profound.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.900 line:98%
It is also usually temporary, and can be fixed.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.900 line:98%
The second type of hearing loss is Sensorineural.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900 line:98%
Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500 line:98%
damage to the inner ear. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.500 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500 line:98%
This loss is caused by damage to the cochlea

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.900 line:98%
and hair cells of the inner ear, or cilia.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500 line:98%
A sensorineural loss can also be caused by damage to the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.200 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.200 line:98%
auditory nerve. The third and final type of hearing loss

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.000 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.000 line:98%
is mixed hearing loss. This is when the loss is both 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.200 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.200 line:98%
conductive and sensorineural, so there is damage to both

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.900 line:98%
the outer, or middle, and inner ear.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.900 line:98%
With normal hearing, if a person can hear sounds 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.500 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.500 line:98%
above 30 decibels, they’re within normal limits.

[normal_hearing]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.900 line:98%
he saw a big fish.

[normal_hearing]

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.900 line:98%
With mild hearing loss, a person begins to hear sounds

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.900 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.900 line:98%

[normal_hearing]

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.900 line:98%
With moderate hearing loss, a person begins to hear sounds

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400 line:98%
[normal_hearing]

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400 line:98%

You can hear some speech sounds like

Severe hearing loss occurs when a patient is

[normal_hearing]

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.900 line:98%
