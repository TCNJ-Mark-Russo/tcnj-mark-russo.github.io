<div class="para">As with other scopes, if a variable is declared within a code block it may not be accessed outside that scope. The compiler can detect this mistake and will let us know when we try to violate this rule. Consider the following small example and the attempt to compile this program in the console session following. The compiler tells us that it cannot access the variable <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">o</code> because it was declared within the scope of the while-statement, a block scope, and so it cannot be accessed outside that scope. This is true even though we access the varaible within the block scope to initialize the fill color of all Oval objects to green.</div>
