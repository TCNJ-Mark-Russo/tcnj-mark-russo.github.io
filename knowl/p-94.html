<div class="para">The foundation of any program is its data, which is created, manipulated, and stored using a computer. Unlike the numerical values that we might write on paper in a mathematics class, when using a computer we must also consider the <em class="emphasis">type</em> of numeric values because each must be stored in our computerâ€™s memory, and each has a different memory size requirement. It will be no surprise that the amount of memory used to store a particular type will increase with the range of values desired as well as how they are encoded in memory. For this reason Java offers multiple primitives types which you may choose to match the anticipated range of values required by your computation.</div>
