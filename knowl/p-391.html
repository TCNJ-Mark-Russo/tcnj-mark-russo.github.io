<div class="para">Because Image is a subclass of Shape it inherits all of the Shape methods. For example, you may resize and move an Image as well as respond to all the standard mouse events. This gives you the ability to programmatically draw on the Image in response to interacting with it using the mouse. The following example draws a randomly-sized green oval where the mouse is pressed. For a more complete program that uses this technique to create a drawing program using DoodlePad, refer to the Interactive Drawing example.</div>
