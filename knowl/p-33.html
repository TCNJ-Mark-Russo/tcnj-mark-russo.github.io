<div class="para">The features of Java include the following.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Simple and Object-Oriented</dfn>: Java was designed to be a simple and easy-to-learn language. It follows the principles of object oriented programming and provides features such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. This makes it suitable for building modular and reusable code.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Platform-Independence</dfn>: One of the key features of Java is its "write once, run anywhere" capability. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system with a <dfn class="terminology">Java Virtual Machine</dfn> (JVM). Once the JVM is ported to run on a computational device, programs written in Java, or one of the JVM family of languages, will run on the device. This allows Java applications to be executed on different platforms without the need for recompilation, making it highly portable.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Robust and Secure</dfn>: Java was built with a strong emphasis on reliability and security. It includes features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), exception handling, and runtime type checking, which help in writing robust and error-free code. Additionally, Java has a security model that prevents unauthorized access to resources and protects against malicious code execution.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Rich Standard Library</dfn>: Java comes with a vast and comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of pre-built classes and application programming interfaces (APIs) for common tasks. The standard library includes packages for networking, input/output (I/O), data structures, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and much more. This extensive library reduces the need to write code from scratch and accelerates development.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Multi-threading</dfn>: Java has built-in support for multi-threading, allowing concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. Multi-threading enables developers to create efficient and responsive applications by dividing tasks into separate threads that can run simultaneously. However, proper synchronization mechanisms need to be employed to ensure thread safety.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Garbage Collection</dfn>: Javaâ€™s automatic garbage collection feature relieves developers from manually managing memory allocation and deallocation. The garbage collector automatically detects and removes unreferenced objects, freeing up memory and reducing the chances of memory leaks and crashes.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Community and Ecosystem</dfn>: Java has a vast and active developer community, which has contributed to the growth of numerous open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools. This vibrant ecosystem makes it easier for developers to leverage existing solutions and accelerates software development.</div></li>
