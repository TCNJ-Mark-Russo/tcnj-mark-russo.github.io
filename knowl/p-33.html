<div class="para">Programming languages are formal languages that allow programmers to write instructions or <em class="emphasis">code</em> to communicate with computers and create software applications. They serve as a means of instructing the computer to perform specific tasks or calculations. Each programming language has its own syntax and set of rules that dictate how code is written and interpreted. In fact, learning a programming language is not dissimilar to learning a foreign spoken language. There are rules that must be followed in order to speak any language correctly, and this goes for programming languages as well. What is different is the interpretation. Unlike a human who interprets a spoken language, a programming language is read by a computer, which is very strict about the use of proper grammar and syntax. Fortunately, the computer programs that read the programs we write will tell us when we make a mistake. This gives us the the opportunity to learn and try again.</div>
