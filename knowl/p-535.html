<div class="para">It is not uncommon to find the two-dimensional layout of objects. Think of the cells of a spreadsheet, keys on a keyboard, pixels on a display, or bricks in a wall. Obviously, the position of elements in a two-dimensional layout are characterized by two coordinate values, one for the first dimension and another for the second dimension. These might be the rows and columns of a spreadsheet or the x,y location of pixels making up a graphics display. Accessing each of these elements requires us to iterate both over one dimension as well as the other dimension to generate all possible index or coordinate pairs. This is accomplished with nested iteration, for example, a while-statement within a while-statement. The outer while-statement generates the index or coordinate for one dimension, and for each of these values, the inner while-statement generates the index or coordinate for the other dimension. The complete inner iteration is repreated for every value of the outer iteration. The result is that on each pass of the inner iteration, we have a new pair of coordinate values.</div>
