<div class="para">This book also introduces a learning library for Java called <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/glossary-doodlepad.html" title="Term: DoodlePad">DoodlePad</a>. Extra effort is made to separate DoodlePad from other material to ensure that the book may be used independent of the library. DoodlePad is an interactive object graphics library for Java which was developed expressely to teach computing in a fun and engaging context. The DoodlePad library provides introductory students with the ability to create Java Swing applications and to render basic graphic objects without the need to master advanced Java concepts (like interfaces) required for using Swing and the AWT. DoodlePad works by bootstrapping the Swing intrastructure as necessary to create a graphics Window and to draw shapes. It also implements a pixel-prefect event dispatch system, which allows introductory students to interact with shapes using the mouse. This event system uses <em class="emphasis">methods references</em>, introduced Java 8, to allow custom event handler methods to be set to handle individual events. Once again, no prerequisite knowledge of advanced Java concepts is necessary.</div>
