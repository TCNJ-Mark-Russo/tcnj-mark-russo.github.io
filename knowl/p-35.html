<div class="para">Executing code written in a high-level programming language is usually (but not always) a two-step process. First a program is translated from its high-level syntax files to a low-level syntax file. Once this translation is successful, the low-level program file is executed by the computerâ€™s hardware. You will perform this translation using a special helper program called the . Depending upon the programming language, this compiled program may be run directly, or it may require other helper programs called a <em class="emphasis">runtime engine</em> and a <em class="emphasis">virtual environment</em>. Learning the toolkit that comes with a programming language is part of learning how to program in the language itself.</div>
