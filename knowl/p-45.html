<div class="para">One more benefit of object oriented programning is <em class="emphasis">inheritance</em>. In most object oriented programming languages it is possible to relate classes to one another in a hierarchical fashion. For example, a Book class and a DVD class might both be related to a more general class called CirculationItem, which encapsualtes all the common properties and behavior shared by all items in a library that circulate. A Book object has its unique properties, like number of pages, and a DVD object has its unique properties, such as run duration, but both have properties like Decimal Dewey number or storage location. Rather than duplicate these common properties in each class, we can add them to the more general CirculationItem class, and then relate both Book and DVD to CirculationItem through <em class="emphasis">inheritance</em>. The inheritance relationship allows both Book and DVD access to the properties and behaviors in the more general CirculationItem class. As programmers, this allows us to author common properties and behaviors once, in CirculationItem, but give all inheriting classes access to the same properties and behaviors. Updating the behaviors in CirculationItem automatically updates the behavior of both Book and DVD. When used correctly, inheritance can be very powerful.</div>
