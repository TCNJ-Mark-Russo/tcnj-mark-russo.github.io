<div class="para">The standard way is to manage instance variables is to declare them with private visibility, and add methods that are used to set the value of the instance variable and to get the value of an instance variable. A method designed to set the value of an instance variable is called a <dfn class="terminology">mutator</dfn> method, also known as a <dfn class="terminology">setter</dfn>. A method designed to get the value of an instance variable is called an <dfn class="terminology">accessor</dfn> method, also known as a <dfn class="terminology">getter</dfn>. By convention, we typically name these methods by prepending the instance variable named with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">set</code> in the case of a mutator method (setters), and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">get</code> in the case of an accessor method (getters).</div>
