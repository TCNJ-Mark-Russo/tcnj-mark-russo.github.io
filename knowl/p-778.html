<div class="para">Other shape features include fill color, stroke color, stroke width, whether the shape may be interactively selected or dragged, the text drawn at its center as well as font family, font size, font style, text colors, transformation, etc. If you consider this list, each one of these features is shared by all shape classes. Does that mean we must declare every one of these instance variables in every class definition? That is quite a lot of code repetition, which, by now, should tell you that something is not quite right. All this code repetition multiplies the effort to maintain your code and increases the chances of making a mistake.</div>
