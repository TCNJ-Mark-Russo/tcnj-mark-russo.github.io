<div class="para">Let’s think about our library Collection object. A Collection knows how to add a reference to a Book object so the Book is considered to be in the Collection. How does this work? What is involved with actually putting a Book object in a Collection object? If you are creating this behavior in the Collection class, then you’ll need to know the details. But if you are only using the behavior, then you can ignore the details and just invoke the behavior when you need it, very similar to driving a car. You can just ask your Collection object to add a Book object to itself. The details don’t matter (assuming you trust the author). They have been abstracted away. As we’ll learn, most modern programming languages come with prewritten and tested software libraries that we can use to write our programs. It is not necessary for us to learn how each works. That detail has been abstracted away and encapsulated in libraries of classes that we can use. Nice.</div>
