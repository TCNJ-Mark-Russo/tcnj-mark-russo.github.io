<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/listing-c1-randomovals.html" title="Listing 6.5.2">ListingÂ 6.5.2</a> we used a while-statement to iterate over the elements of an ArrayList to access each Oval object and change its fill color. We now know that we could done the job using a for-statement as well. In both cases we would declare, initialize, and update a loop counter. We also need to correctly write the condition that tests for continuation of the iteration. The need to access all elements of a Collection is common, and so a special statement was introduced to make this easier and less open to error by eliminating the counter variable altogether. The <dfn class="terminology">for-each</dfn> statement, also known as the <em class="emphasis">enahanced-for</em>, will iterate over any Collection that supports it, without the need for a loop counter variable.</div>
