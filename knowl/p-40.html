<div class="para">Imagine that you have been called upon to write a program that manages the items in a brick-and-mortar library. Among other things, the job of a library is to maintain, track, and lend items from its collection, including books, reference materials, digital recordings, and more. It must also track who has permission to borrow items from the library.
