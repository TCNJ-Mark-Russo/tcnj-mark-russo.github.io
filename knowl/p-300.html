<div class="para">Another item to note about our updated program is how the code itself is laid out. You’ll notice that the two methods are indented within the set of curly braces that enclose the class declaration, and the statements that define each method are indented further. The parameter delcarations of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">distanceBetween()</code> method are even indented so the second pair of parameters is right under the first pair. This formatting helps us see and understand how a program is organized at a glance, but it is not necessary, at least as far as the Java compiler is concerned. In fact, the Java compiler will compile the following listing with no trouble. But I don’t recommend it.</div>
