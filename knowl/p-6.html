<div class="para">DoodlePad was designed conservatively. All user-initiated graphics commands are first checked to see if they are being invoked on a thread different than the main AWT event-dispatching thread. If so, it uses <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">SwingUtils.invokeLater()</code> to invoke the user-initiated command to ensure that the command is not execute immediately, but instead is added to the AWT event-dispatching thread. This makes it possible for student programs to interact with Swing programs seamlessly. It also makes the interactive nature of invoking graphics programs from JShell work without a hitch. While crossing thread boundaries does incur a performance penalty, it shelters introductory students from the complexities of cross-thread programming and achieves one of the libraries main goals, which is for a program to "just work."</div>
