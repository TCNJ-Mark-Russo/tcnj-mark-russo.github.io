<div class="para">One of the real benefits of object oriented programming is <em class="emphasis">abstraction</em>. When I drive a car, I don’t need to know all the underlying details. I know that if I press the button in my electric car, then engine comes on. I know if I put the car in gear and press the accelerator, the car moves. There is quite a lot of engineering that makes this possible, but I don’t need to know all the details. From my perspective as a driver, I need only understand how to make the car move, turn, and stop. The details of how the car works have been abstracted away, making it possible for me to operate a car with minimal knowledge. This is power of abstraction.</div>
