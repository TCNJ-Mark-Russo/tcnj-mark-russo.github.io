<div class="para">All computational devices have similar characteristics and are made up of the same or similar key components.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Hardware</dfn>: Computers consist of physical components that perform the actual computations. The hardware includes the central processing unit (CPU), which serves as the "brain" of the computer and executes instructions. Other important hardware components include memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drives, solid-state drives), input devices (keyboard, mouse), output devices (monitor, printer), and various peripheral devices (USB devices, network cards, etc.).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Software</dfn>: Software refers to the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do. It includes operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, or Linux) that manage the computerâ€™s resources, as well as application software that performs specific tasks or provides services. Software is typically written in programming languages and compiled or interpreted into machine code that the hardware can understand and execute.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Data Representation</dfn>: Computers use binary representation, which means they store and manipulate data in the form of binary digits (bits). Binary digits are either 0 or 1, and they can represent various types of information, such as numbers, text, images, and sound. Higher-level abstractions are used to interpret and manipulate data, allowing for complex operations and computations.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Processing and Execution</dfn>: Computers perform computations by executing instructions sequentially. These instructions are represented in machine code, which is a low-level language that the CPU can directly understand and execute. The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and performs the necessary calculations or operations. The results are then stored back in memory or sent to output devices.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Input and Output</dfn>: Computers interact with users and the external world through input and output devices. Input devices, like keyboards and mice, allow users to provide data and instructions to the computer. Output devices, such as monitors and printers, display or present the results of computations or provide information to users. Other input and output devices include scanners, microphones, speakers, and various sensors used in embedded systems.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Connectivity and Networking</dfn>: Computers can be connected to networks, allowing them to communicate and share data with other devices. This enables tasks like accessing the internet, transferring files, sharing resources, and remote collaboration. Networking protocols and technologies, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, facilitate data exchange between computers and other devices.</div></li>
