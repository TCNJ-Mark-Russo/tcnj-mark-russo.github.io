<div class="para">As a demonstration, letâ€™s create a graphic class named LED. This class will be a circular graphic object with width and height of 30 pixels. The graphic is filled with gray when it is off and red when it is on. When deciding what to include in any class, we need to stop and think about what is necessary to adequatley track the state of each instance. For an LED, we need to track whether it is on or off. We also need to manage its graphic representation, in this case an Oval object.</div>
