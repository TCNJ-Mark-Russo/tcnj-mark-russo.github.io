<div class="para">In situations like the above, when Java creates objects but does not assign them to a reference variable, we refer to the objects as <dfn class="terminology">anonymous</dfn> because they are never given a variable name. This does not mean that the objects were not created. In fact, they were created, but they had a fleeting existence as they were passed down the chain of methods.</div>
