<div class="para">This illustrates an important fact about Java. That is, <dfn class="terminology">Whitespace rarely matters</dfn>. We do need a space or linefeed here or there to separate certain language tokens, but not too many. But that doesn’t mean your programs should look like the above. In fact, part of your job while programming is to write your code so that it is understandable by others. To that end, <dfn class="terminology">Always format and comment your code</dfn>. This is your way of communicating your program organization and how it works, even if you are communicating only to your future self. It’s best not to be the person who looks back at a program they wrote in the past and has no idea about what it does.</div>
