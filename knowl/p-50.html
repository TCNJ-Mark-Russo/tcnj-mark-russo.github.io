<div class="para">One pitfall often experienced after a new installation is the inability to access JDK commands from a terminal. The JDK installs successfully, the new user opens and terminal, and proceeds to test the new installation by entering the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">java -version</code>, which should print the version of Java that is installed. Instead, the command is not found and an error is printed to the terminal. If the JDK is indeed installs successfully, the program is almost always associated with the directory paths that a terminal searches for a command after the command is entered. Only if the command program can be found on one of those paths can the command be executed. These search paths are stored in an operating system environment variable, frequently named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">PATH</code>. For example, on Windows you can search for the "Environment Variables" program and use that to inspect the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">PATH</code> environment variable and edit it to add a filesystem path to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bin</code> subdirectory under the location of where the JDK is installed. It is the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bin</code> subdirectory where youâ€™ll find the JDK commands.</div>
