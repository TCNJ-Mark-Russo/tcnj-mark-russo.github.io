<div class="para">String immutability is not a problem when concatenating a few small Strings, but when large Strings are concatenated over and over to build even larger String objects, your program can slow down because larger and larger chuncks of memory are repeatedly allocated and deallocated. A more efficient approach to concatenating large and numerous String objects would be a dedicated class with the job of collecting all Strings and then managing the underlying memory more efficiently. This is what Javaâ€™s built-in StringBuilder class does for us.</div>
