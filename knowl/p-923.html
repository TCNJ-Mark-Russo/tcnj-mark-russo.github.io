<div class="para">A more fundamental way to think of a file is as an ordered sequence of bytes that is assigned a unique name plus location (a path) in file system storage. A file system also stores properties about a file, such as who has access to the fileâ€™s contents and whether or not it should be interpreted as data or an executable program. How to interpret these bytes varies widely. Even within a single category of file type, algorithms for extracting file contents can be drastically different. For example, the difference between a JPEG and BMP is significant.</div>
