<div class="para">Youâ€™ve invented a dart game that awards a different number of points to a player when a dart lands within each of four concentric circles. The game board is 600mm by 600mm, so the center is at (300mm, 300mm). The outer (yellow) band is bounded by circles with radii 75mm and 100mm and has a point value of 1. This next (blue) band is bounded by circles with radii 50mm and 75mm and has a point value of 2. This next (green) band is bounded by circles with radii 20mm and 50mm and has a point value of 3. And the center (red) circle has radius of 20mm with a point value of 4. The game board is instrumented with sensors; it reports the (x, y) coordinates in mm when any dart lands.</div>
