<div class="para">Another example of an object might be the relationship between a Book object and a Borrower object. A Book may have had many Borrowers and a Borrower may be borrowing many Books. Rather than choose to encapsulate a list of Books in a Borrower or a list of Borrows in a Book, you might want an object that models that relationship between a book and a borrower. We might encapsualte the properties of this relationship a Circulate object. A Circulate object might have one reference to a Book, one to a Borrower, a date that the Book was lent, a date that the Book is due to be returned to the Library, and whether or not it is overdue.</div>
