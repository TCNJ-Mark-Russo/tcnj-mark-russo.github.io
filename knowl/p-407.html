<div class="para">The scale(...) transformation comes in different forms. Thus far we have assumed that the scale factor is applied equally to the x- and y-axes, but this is not necessary. Different scale factors may be applied to the x- and y-axes, and certain overloads of the scale(...) method permit different scale factors for each axis. Also note that when the axes of a Shapeâ€™s coordinate system are modified due to a scale(...) transformation, by default all changes are performed around the origin (0, 0). That is to say, all points in the scaled coordinate system will appear to move, except (0, 0). The origin remains fixed, unless a special overload of the transformation is applied. The Shape class implements four overloads of the scale(...) method to account for all these options. The first option is scale(double factor) that takes one scale factor applies it to both the x- and y-axes around the origin (0, 0). The second option is scale(double xFactor, double yFactor) in which the separate scale factors may be applied to each axis. The third option is scale(double factor, double xCenter, double yCenter) in which the same scale factor is applied to both axes, but the scale is applied around the point (xCenter, yCenter) instead of (0,0). This is convenient when a point other than the origin should remain fixed, for example when you want to grow or shrink the size of a shape at its current location. The fourth option is scale(double xFactor, double yFactor, double xCenter, double yCenter) in which independent scale factors are to be applied and a point other than the origin should remain fixed.</div>
