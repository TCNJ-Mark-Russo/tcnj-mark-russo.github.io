<div class="para">In this example we implement a simple graphical toggle button class named PushButton. For the button graphic we use a RoundRect Shape object. The PushButton constructor creates the RoundRect object and initializes its fill cellors to gray. The PushButton class tracks its state using an isOn boolean instance variable. The class is initialized with isOn = false implying the button is initially off. The constructor also uses the setMousePressedHandler method to indicate that the objectâ€™s onPressed method should be invoked when the RoundRect shape is pressed with the mouse. The onPressed method toggles the value of isOn and then resets the RoundRect fill cellor based on the current PushButton state. When the RoundRect is pressed with the mouse, the PushButton object state is toggled and the RoundRect fill cellor changes to green, indicating that the button was pressed. A second press toggles PushButton off and sets the RoundRect fill cellor back to gray.</div>
