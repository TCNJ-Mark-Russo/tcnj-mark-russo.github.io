<div class="para">Imagine that you have been called upon to write a program that manages the items in a brick-and-mortar library. Among other things, the job of a library is to maintain, track, and lend items from its collection, including books, reference materials, digital recordings, and more. It must also track who has permission to borrow items from the library. What then might be the objects associated with a library management system? There are several material items that we can identify right away. For example, a Book, a DVD, a Borrower, or even a Bookshelf, might be items that your library management software system might need to model and manage. A Book object may be described by several data items, including a title, authors, publication date, a Dewey Decimal identifier, library storage location, and whether or not it is currently checked out or available for circulation. Each of these data items are properties of a Book object and, in accordinate with the the principles of object oriented programming, should be encapsulated within the Book software object. The same arguments may be made for other library system objects, such as DVD, Borrower, and Bookshelf.</div>
