<div class="para">The foundation of any program is its data, which we will create, manipulate, and store using a computational device. Unlike the the numbers that we might write on paper in a mathematics class, when using a computer we must also consider the <em class="emphasis">type</em> of numeric values desired because each must be stored in memory, and each has a different memory size requirement. It will be no surprise that the amount of memory used to store a particular type will increase with the range of these values as well as how they are encoded in memory. For this reason Java offers multiple types of primitives which you may choose to match the anticipated range of values that your computation may require.</div>
