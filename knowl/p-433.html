<div class="para">Applying the scale transformation is a very convenient way to change the size of an object, but the outcome may not be what you expect. When a coodinate system is scaled, everything that is drawn is scaled, including a Shape’s stroke width. Consider a Shape drawn with a stroke width of 1. After applying a scale transformation of 2 to the Shape’s coodinate system, the Shape with the scaled coordinate system will appear to be drawn with stroke width of 2. From the perspective of the scaled Shape, the stroke width is 1. But when compared to Shapes with unscaled coordinate systems, the stroke will appear to have a width of 2. Often, this is not the desired outcome.</div>
