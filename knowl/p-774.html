<div class="para">As your programs grow in size, you will create more classes, many of which will have identical methods and fields. This situation ends up making program maintenance very difficult and violates the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/assemblage-dry.html" title="Assemblage: Principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)">DRY</a> principle. Consider a scenario in which multiple Shape classes all define the same fill-color getter and setter methods. If you decide to add an overload to these methods accepting a new kind of Color object, you’ll have to find all the classes that implement these methods and make the identical update to each. This is a tedious and error-prone process. Sooner or later a mistake will be made. It is much better to define the methods once, and let each of the class make use of the same implementation. This is exactly what an inheritance relationship gives us.</div>
