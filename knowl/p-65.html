<div class="para">JDK tools like <dfn class="terminology">javac</dfn> are executed using programs like a terminal or command prompt program. Every operating system provides one or more terminal programs for executing commands, and they differ in subtle ways. Typically, these programs start as black boxes that accept text commands and usually output results as text as well. Terminal programs may run a shell, which provides more sophisticated capabilities for running commands and interacting with the underlying operating system. The shell you choose also can impact how commands are entered. While we cannot cover the details of every terminal and every shell, we will point out common pitfalls for popular options.</div>
