<div class="para">Taken together, the key principles of object-oriented programming are:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Encapsulation</dfn>: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and related behavior (methods or functions) into a single unit called an object. The data, also known as attributes or properties, tend be accessed and modified by the methods defined in the class. Encapsulation helps in organizing code, as the internal workings of an object are hidden from the outside, and it also provides data protection and security.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Inheritance</dfn>: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and behaviors. The existing class is called the "parent class", "base class", or "superclass", and the new class is called the "child class","derived class", or "subclass". The child class can extend or modify the behavior of the parent class by adding new methods or overriding existing ones. Inheritance promotes code reuse and supports the concept of hierarchical relationships between classes.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Polymorphism</dfn>: Polymorphism means that objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types (classes), as long as they share a common interface or base class. Polymorphism enables more flexible and extensible code, as it allows for method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding means that a subclass can provide its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass, while method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist in a class.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Abstraction</dfn>: Abstraction focuses on capturing the essential features and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to create abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods without specifying their implementation. Concrete classes that inherit from abstract classes or implement interfaces provide the implementation details. Abstraction helps in designing complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and modular components.</div></li>
