<div class="para">The example presented in this section combines many different features of the Java programming language. Each of the classes defined encapsulate, initialize, and coordinate the many parts of object to produce self-managed cohesive widgets, each with a custom design and behavior. Inheritance was used to start our new classes with a large amount of baseline functionality, with only object-specific customizations added. An interface was defined and implemented as a way to require that certain methods are created in all implementing classes and to enable sorting of an array using prewritten algorithms provided by the Java Core Library. Overall, the many aspects of object oriented programming each have their distinct benefits and they fit together well to produce sophisticated results.</div>
