<div class="para">Let’s say we wanted to write a program that stores the dinner orders of a table full of people. We may not know how many people will sit at a table, and an integer index is not be suitable to track orders because table chairs are not numbered, and even if they were, people may rearrange themselves. What we really want to do is to map a person’s name, a String, to a list of the items in their dinner order, perhaps an ArrayList&lt;String&gt;. That’s right. An ArrayList is an object, so we can declare our HashMap to be keyed by String objects that are associated with ArrayList&lt;String&gt; values.</div>
