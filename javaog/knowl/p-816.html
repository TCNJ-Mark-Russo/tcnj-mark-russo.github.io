<div class="para">The statement that performs the division was moved into a try-block, so any problems with this statement will be caught. Following the try-block is a catch-block, which is followed by a pair of parentheses containing the declaration of an ArithmeticException variable. This format indicates that any exception object that can be bound to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">e</code> variable will cause program flow to enter the catch-block. Remember, due to subtype polymorphism, we can assign any object a type class or any one of its derived classes to a variable of type class. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/listing-ex-try.html" title="Listing 11.3.2">ListingÂ 11.3.2</a>, the catch-block with handle any thrown ArithmeticException objects, or objects with a type that matches any classes that derive from ArithmeticException. In this example an ArithmeticException was thrown, which matches the declaration in the catch-block, and so the message is printed.</div>
