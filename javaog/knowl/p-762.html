<div class="para">Inheritance has its privileges. We saw several examples in which a derived class has access to all base class behavior merely because it extends the base class. Recall how we were able to invoke <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">setFontSize(…)</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">setFontStyle(…)</code> on the ToggleButton class even when these methods were not implemented (See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/listing-in-togglebutton3.html" title="Listing 9.3.3">Listing 9.3.3</a>). You may not have realized that this is possible only because the base class methods were declared public. Well, this doesn’t seem like much of an advantage, does it? After all, public methods are accessible anywhere within a program. By comparison, private methods are accessible only from within the implementing class, and not from a derived class. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-in-public-private.html" title="Figure 9.4.5">Figure 9.4.5</a> illustrates this situation.</div>
