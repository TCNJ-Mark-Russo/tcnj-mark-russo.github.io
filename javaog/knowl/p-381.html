<em class="emphasis">Class variables</em>, also known as <em class="emphasis">static variables</em>, are declared within a class and associated with the class itself rather than with specific instances of the class. We refer to this as <dfn class="terminology">class scope</dfn>. Variables and methods declared using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">static</code> keyword exist within the scope of the class within which it is declared. Static variables have lifetimes that are as long as the class exists, which is for the entire time that a program is running.</div>
