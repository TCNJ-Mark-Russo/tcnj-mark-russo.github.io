<div class="para">Executing a sequence of of Java statements is useful, especially when we have a deterministic calculation to perform. But it is often the case that we want to perform different calculations depending on the outcome of some expression, the response of a user, or another condition in our program. For example, we might use a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Scanner</code> class to ask the user what they would like the program to do on their behalf. We need to read the input and execute only the relevant part of your program.</div>
