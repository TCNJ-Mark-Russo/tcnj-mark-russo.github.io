<div class="para">As is the case with all classes, ArrayList implements constructors and methods that allow us to instantiate and work with the object. Because the ArrayList class is designed to manage a series of objects, its methods relate to these management tasks as well. The following table lists many common ArrayList constructors and methods. The class of objects held by the ArrayList is not known until the ArrayList is instantiated. This class is indicated in the following table by a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">T</code> for <em class="emphasis">type</em>. Once an ArrayList is instantiated, substitute <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">T</code> with the class specified within the diamond operator.</div>
