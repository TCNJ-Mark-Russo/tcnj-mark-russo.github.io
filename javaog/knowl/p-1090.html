<div class="para">Images may be constructed blank, or upon construction they may load and display an image from a file. This behavior is governed by the constructor used to create an Image. Following are three Image object constructors. The first constructor creates an blank Image with the givel location (xm y) and dimensions (width, height). The second constructor creates an Image object and loads an image from a file, given a path to it on the file system. The dimensions of the Image are set to match the dimensions of the image loaded from the file. The third constructor creats an Image object of the given dimensions, and also loads and resizes the image stored in the given file path prior to displaying it. For all Image constructors, refer to the docs.</div>
