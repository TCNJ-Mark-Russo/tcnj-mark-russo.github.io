<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">file extension</dfn> of a file name is a hint to the operating system about the fileâ€™s type, but not a guarantee. A file extension is the final few characters that make up a file name after the final "." character. Examples are ".txt", ".docx", ".html", ".exe". Operating systems typically use the extension to identify the program that knows how to open the file and interpet its contents. Never open a file unless you trust the author, especially a file that is <em class="emphasis">executable</em>. On the Windows operating system, an executable file often has a ".exe" extension. On other operating systems, a file is executable if one of its file system properties identifies it as such.</div>
