<div class="para">It is not uncommon to find a two-dimensional layout of objects. Think of the cells of a spreadsheet, keys on a keyboard, pixels on a display, or bricks in a wall. The position of elements in a two-dimensional layout are characterized by two coordinate or two index values: one for the first dimension and another for the second dimension. These might be the rows and columns of a spreadsheet or the x,y location of pixels in an image. Accessing each of these elements requires us to iterate both over one dimension as well as the other dimension to generate all possible indexes or coordinate pairs. This is accomplished with nested iteration, for example, a while-statement within a while-statement. The outer while-statement generates the index or coordinate for one dimension, and for each of these values, the inner while-statement generates the index or coordinate for the other dimension. All iterations of the inner statement is repreated for every iteration of the outer statement. The result is that on each pass of the inner iteration, we have a unique pair of indexes or coordinate values.</div>
