<div class="para">The state of all active methods is saved in an internal data structure called a <dfn class="terminology">stack frame</dfn>. A stack frame tracks an active methodâ€™s scope (variables and their instantaneous values) and on which instruction to resume execution when the invoked method completes. There are as many stack frames as your program has active methods, all of which are stored in another data structure called the <dfn class="terminology">call stack</dfn>. To visualize a call stack, think of a stack of clean dinner plates. Typically, you add to the top of a stack, and remove from the top of the stack. It is the same with the call stack data structure. When a new stack frame (dinner plate) is created as a result of one method invoking another, the stack frame is <em class="emphasis">pushed</em> onto the top of the call stack. When the invoked method completes, the stack frame describing the paused method is <em class="emphasis">popped</em> off the top of the stack and used to resume execution.</div>
