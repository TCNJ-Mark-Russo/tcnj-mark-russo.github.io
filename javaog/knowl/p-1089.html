<div class="para">Once again, to illustrate how these control points impact the shape of the Path side added with the curveTo(…) method, have a cose look at the accompanying interactive widget. In this case the first control point is outlined in red, and the second is outlined in green. The boxes in this widget are interactive; click and drag them to get a sense for how the shape of the side added with curveTo(…) changes with the position of the associated control points. The first control point governs the shape of start of the curved side and the second control point governs the shape of the end of the curved side. The coordinates of both control points are drawn at the bottom of the widget.</div>
