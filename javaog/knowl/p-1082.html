<div class="para">The second transformation is scale(...). In effect, a scale(...) transformation zooms in or zooms out on the coordinate system of an object. For example, invoking the scale(...) method with an argument of 2 essentially zooms in by a factor of 2. The coordinate x=50 of the unscaled coordinate system will move to a screen location where x=100 used to be located. Similarly, if a coordinate system is scaled by 0.5, the coordinate x=50 in the unscaled coodinate system will move to a screen location where x=25 used to be located. The same arguments apply to the y-coordinate of the coordinate system. When a shapeâ€™s coordinate system is scaled by a number greater than 1, the effect is to increase the size or zoom in on the shape, thus drawing it larger with respect to other shapes with unscaled coordinate systems. With a scale factor less than 1, the effect is to reduce the size or zoom out on a shape as compared to other shapes with unscaled coordinate systems.</div>
