<div class="para">For example, the image on the right depicts two Rectangle Shapes, both with dimensions 50 pixels × 50 pixels and coordinates x=0, y=0. One Rectangle has a red fill and the other has a green fill. The difference between the two Shapes is that the green Rectangle has been transformed by translating it to the location (100, 100). In other words, the origin of the green Rectangle’s coordinate system has been moved (translated) to (100, 100). The green Rectangle’s coordinates (0, 0) are at the same screen location as the red Rectangle’s coordinates (100, 100). In spite of the fact that both Rectangles have identical dimensions and location with respect to their own coordinate systems, they are drawn at different parts of the Pad due to the fact that the green Rectangle’s coordinate system was translated from its default value.</div>
