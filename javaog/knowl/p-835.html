<div class="para">Fortunately, modern editors will help you find your syntax errors long before you compile your program. Good editors for programming may even suggest what might be wrong and offer a solution that can be performed automatically, such as adding a forgotten import. Language-specific editor plug-ins are especially useful. AI-driven plug-ins are now available as well. These will suggest the next thing that you may want to add to your program based on what you typed in the past. Be very careful with AI plug-ins. Make sure you understand what is suggested; there is no guarantee suggestions are correct.</div>
