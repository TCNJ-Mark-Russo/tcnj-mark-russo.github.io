<div class="para">If you dig in to the details of Fibonacci number calculation, you will see that the naive implementation of the recursive definition is very inefficient. To compute <span class="process-math">\(F_{10}\)</span> we must compute <span class="process-math">\(F_9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_8\text{.}\)</span> To compute <span class="process-math">\(F_9\)</span> we first (recursively) compute <span class="process-math">\(F_8\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_7\text{.}\)</span> We need <span class="process-math">\(F_8\)</span> to compute <span class="process-math">\(F_{10}\text{,}\)</span> but we are computing it for <span class="process-math">\(F_9\)</span> as well, and then throwing it away! We are forced to recompute <span class="process-math">\(F_8\)</span> twice: once for <span class="process-math">\(F_{10}\)</span> and a second time for <span class="process-math">\(F_9\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(F_8\)</span> we need <span class="process-math">\(F_7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F_6\text{,}\)</span> but again, we are computing <span class="process-math">\(F_7\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(F_8\)</span> and throwing it away, but we need it for <span class="process-math">\(F_9\text{.}\)</span> The result is a highly inefficient compounding and repetition of the same computation over and over, as you proceed down the chain of dependencies. It certainly seems it would be more efficient to cache intermediate Fibonacci numbers and look them up if they are needed again for subsequent calculations.</div>
