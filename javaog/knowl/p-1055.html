<div class="para">Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the DoodlePad library is the ease and extent to which it supports event driven programming. All DoodlePad Shape objects as well as the Pad object may be set up to invoke custom methods in response to a wide range of user interaction. For example, you may want the change the fill color of one or more shapes when the user hovers over the shape or clicks the shape with the mouse. Alternatively, you may want to move a Shape in specific direction when the user presses one of the arrow keys. The Pad object implements timer functionality that raises tick events at a user-specified rate. You may want to invoke one or more of your custom methods each time the Pad’s timer ticks, which may be accomplished using the Pad’s tick event.</div>
