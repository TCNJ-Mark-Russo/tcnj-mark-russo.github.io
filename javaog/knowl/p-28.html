<div class="para">It is worth taking a moment to understand what is meant by <em class="emphasis">binary data representation</em>. If you could look at computer memory and see the data stored, youâ€™d see that all memory locations can store only two states. Depending upon the kind of memory, these two state are represented in different ways: charged or neutral, a local magnetic field pointing up or down, reflective or dispersive of a laser, conductive or not. We represent these two states as 0 and 1, and call them <em class="emphasis">bits</em>. Also, we always consider bits in groups of 8, called <em class="emphasis">bytes.</em> One byte is composed of eight ordered bits.</div>
