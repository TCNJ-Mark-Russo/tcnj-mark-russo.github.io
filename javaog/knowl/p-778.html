<div class="para">Public members are accessible from anywhere in a program. Explicit scoping may be required, but access is granted. Protected members prohibit access from outside the implementing class other than derived classes, which may access protected members. Private member access is limited strictly to the implementing class and its objects. A fourth type of visibility occurs when no visibility modifier is specified. This type of visibility is called <dfn class="terminology">package-private</dfn> because members with no visibility modifier are accessible from within the implementing class as well as from within its package, but from no other scope.</div>
