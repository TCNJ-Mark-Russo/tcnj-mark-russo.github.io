<div class="para">All of the methods that we’ve written in previous chapters were static (i.e. class scope). This was determined when adding the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">static</code> keyword to the method declaration. By contrast, the object-scoped methods we used, were defined in either core Java libraries or other provided libraries, like those in DoodlePad. To take advantage of the object-oriented nature of Java we need to declare object-scoped fields that hold data specific to the instance and methods that have access to these fields. This enables us to define our own objects that <dfn class="terminology">encapsulate</dfn> and manage data in accordance with the principles of object-oriented programming. Let’s learn how to define our own instantiatable classes that encapsulate object-specific data.</div>
