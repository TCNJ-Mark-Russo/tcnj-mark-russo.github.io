<div class="para">Other than these changes, the remainder of the LED class remains unchanged. The outpur from this version of LED is identical to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-cl-led5.html" title="Figure 8.3.5">FigureÂ 8.3.5</a>. Using inheritance we were able to remove several references from the derived class because we can now depend upon inheriting these from the base class. In fact, we gained a huge amount of behavior from the base class, which can be applied to expanding LED by invoking directly, without the need to relay to an encpasulated Oval object.</div>
