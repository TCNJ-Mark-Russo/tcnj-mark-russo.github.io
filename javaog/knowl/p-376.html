<div class="para">Note that the two if-statements above are <em class="emphasis">mutually exclusive</em>. There are no values of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x1, y1</code> that will cause both if-statement blocks to execute. This is important. Both if-statements are indepependent of one another and so both conditions are tested when the method runs. We never want the code blocks of both if-statements to execute. That would award too many points to the player and our game would have a bug. Writing several if-statements in succession where only one block of code in the group should execute, is a strategy that weâ€™ll call <dfn class="terminology">mutually exclusive conditionals</dfn>. The conditions in each if-statement must be written carefully so that only one will evaluate to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">true</code> at any time.</div>
