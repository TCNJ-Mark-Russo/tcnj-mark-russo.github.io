<div class="para">In a third application, a derived class might override a base class method as a way of stopping its execution, and simply returning. This might be used when a derived class is designed to simulate the behavior of a base class during testing. If certain base class methods are expensive to execute, we can use a derived class to catch and surpress the execution of certain base class methods during testing, and then remove the derived class before final release.</div>
