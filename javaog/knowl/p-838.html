<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-ex-exception-class-hierarchy.html" title="Figure 11.2.1">FigureÂ 11.2.1</a> under the Throwable class, things that can go wrong in Java at runtime are grouped under two broad base classes, <dfn class="terminology">Error</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Exception</dfn>. Classes that derive from Error are very serious problems from which there is no recovery possible. These tend to occur when system resources are exhausted, such as when an instance of the OutOfMemoryError class, the StackOverflowError class, or the ominous ThreadDeath class, is thrown. Because we cannot catch and handle these exceptions, the best we can do is note that they exist and hope we never encounter them. The Exception class and its derived classes are of more interest because we can catch these exceptions and hopefully handle them in a productive way.</div>
