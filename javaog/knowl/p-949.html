<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">algorithm</dfn> is a well defined set of instructions for how to solve a particular problem. The study of algorithms is broad, covering a wide range of techniques as well as mathematical analyses that compare algorithms from different perpectives, such as how the number of operations and the memory required grows with the size of the problem. These comparisons help us choose the best algorithm option for a given proble or how your data is stored. In this section we will describe two types of algorithms called sorting and searching as well as introduce ways these algorithms are compared.</div>
