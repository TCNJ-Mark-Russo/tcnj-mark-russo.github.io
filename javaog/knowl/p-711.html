<div class="para">What are the other features of shape classes that must be encapsulated? Every shape needs an (x, y) location and the dimensions (width, height). In DoodlePad we decided that these parameters would describe a shapeâ€™s bounding box and that the shape would be drawn within that bounding box. Shape location is the location of the upper left corner of the bounding box and shape dimensions match the dimensions of the bounding box. These four instance variables (x, y, width, height) are common to all shape classes. Does that mean we must repeat these instance variable declarations in all shape classes?</div>
