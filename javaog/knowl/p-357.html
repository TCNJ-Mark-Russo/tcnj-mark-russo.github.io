<div class="para">String immutability is not a problem when concatenating a few small Strings, but when large Strings are concatenated over and over to build even larger String objects, your program can slow down because larger and larger chunks of memory are repeatedly allocated and deallocated. A more efficient approach to concatenating large and numerous String objects is a dedicated class that manages memory more efficiently, inflating an internal memory store less frequently, in larger increments, and only when necessary. This is what Javaâ€™s built-in <dfn class="terminology">StringBuilder</dfn> class does for us.</div>
