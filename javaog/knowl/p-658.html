<div class="para">The standard way is to manage instance variable values is to declare them with private visibility, and add methods that are used to set the value of the instance variable as well as to get the value of an instance variable. A method designed to set the value of an instance variable is called a <dfn class="terminology">mutator</dfn> method, also known as a <dfn class="terminology">setter</dfn>. A method designed to get the value of an instance variable is called an <dfn class="terminology">accessor</dfn> method, also known as a <dfn class="terminology">getter</dfn>. By convention, we typically name these methods by prepending the instance variable named with <dfn class="terminology">set</dfn> in the case of a mutator method (setters), and <dfn class="terminology">get</dfn> in the case of an accessor method (getters).</div>
