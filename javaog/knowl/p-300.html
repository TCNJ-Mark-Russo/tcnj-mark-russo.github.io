<div class="para">Now we really have something very nice. In our second version of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ComputeDistance</code> program, we have our class defined with a name that matches its file (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ComputeDistance.java</code>). Within the class we declare a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main(…)</code> method with the proper signature so Java knows were to start exectuion. And we have a helper method named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">distanceBetween(…)</code> which encapsulates and abstracts away the details associated with computing the distance between two points. Because we encapsulated the distance formula in its own method, we can invoke the method twice using only its name and passing the four <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">doubles</code>. Never again do we need to remember the details of the distance formula nor how to write it in Java. This is the power of <em class="emphasis">abstraction</em> and <em class="emphasis">encapsulation</em>.</div>
