<div class="para">At the bottom of the two main branches of the Exception class hierarchy in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-ex-exception-class-hierarchy.html" title="Figure 11.2.1">FigureÂ 11.2.1</a> you will find the two labels <em class="emphasis">(checked exceptions)</em> and <em class="emphasis">(unchecked exceptions)</em>. The right branch, including RuntimeException and all its derived classes are considered <dfn class="terminology">unchecked</dfn> exception classes. This means that if a block of code has the potential to throw one of these exception classes, it is not necessary to catch the exception. Java <em class="emphasis">does not check</em> that these exceptions are thrown. On the other hand, classes under the left branch, that is, derived classes of Exception but not RuntimeException or one of its derived classes, are considered <dfn class="terminology">checked exceptions</dfn>. If a block of code has the potential to throw a checked exception, including IOException or one of its derived classes such as FileNotFoundException, then either the code must be placed in a try-block or the exception may be deferred by indicating that the exception is thrown by modifying the method using a <dfn class="terminology">throws</dfn> keyword and the exception class name. In either case, the exception must be caught somewhere in your program.</div>
