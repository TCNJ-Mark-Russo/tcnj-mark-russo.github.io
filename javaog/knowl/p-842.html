<div class="para">Logic errors are caught during testing. You might be performing informal testing after implementing a feature, or you might have handed off your program to a formal testing team, who’s job it is to compare your program’s behavior against prewritten specifications. In any case, logic errors can be hard to find. It is difficult to anticipate how a program will be used once it is in the hands of someone else. Try to test all possible inputs and interactions, however improbable.</div>
