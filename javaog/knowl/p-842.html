<div class="para">The important thing to know about runtime errors is that they may be <dfn class="terminology">caught</dfn> at runtime, and handled gracefully, without causing your program to dump a trace of the call stack. Typical runtime errors include inadvertently dividing by zero, or attempting to open a file that does not exist. A trace of the call stack might be useful to you, but it is generally useless to the average user of your program. The message "File not found. Please try again." is far more useful to the average user than a trace of the call stack.</div>
