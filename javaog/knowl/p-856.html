<div class="para">We can also catch an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception by adding another catch-statement to the try-catch. In fact, we can add as many catch-statements as we like, with the understanding that the first catch-block with a variable declaration that can be assigned to the thrown exception object is the one that will execute. But what if another type of exception is thrown, one that we have not anticipated? Rather than testing specifically for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, let’s move up the Exception class hierarchy and take advantage of <em class="emphasis">subtype polymorphism</em> to catch multiple exceptions with a single catch-statement. From <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-ex-exception-class-hierarchy.html" title="Figure 11.2.1">Figure 11.2.1</a> we know that all exceptions inherit Exception. Let’s update <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/listing-ex-extest1.html" title="Listing 11.3.3">Listing 11.3.3</a> to catch Exception objects as well, and test our program again. See modifications in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/listing-ex-extest2.html" title="Listing 11.3.4">Listing 11.3.4</a>. Note that in the catch-block we are simply printing the exception object directly. Because Exception classes override <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">toString()</code> by returning a String description of the exception, the result is a reasonably informative indication of the problem that occurred.</div>
