<div class="para">Let’s think again about our library Collection object. A Collection knows how to add a reference to a Book object so the Book is considered to be in the Collection. How does this work? What is involved with actually putting a Book object into a Collection object? If you are adding this behavior to the Collection class, then you’ll need to know the details. But if you are only using the behavior, then you can ignore the details and just invoke the behavior when you need it, very similar to driving a car. You can just ask your Collection object to add a Book object to itself. The details don’t matter (assuming you trust the author). They have been <em class="emphasis">abstracted away</em>. As we’ll learn, most modern programming languages come with prewritten and tested software libraries that we can use to write our programs. It is not necessary for us to learn the underlying details about how each works, only how to use them. The detail has been abstracted away and encapsulated by libraries of classes that we can use. Nice!</div>
