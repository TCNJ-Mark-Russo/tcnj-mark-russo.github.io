<div class="para">Other than these changes, the remainder of the LED class remains unchanged. The output from this version of LED is identical to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-cl-led5.html" title="Figure 8.3.5">FigureÂ 8.3.5</a>. Using inheritance we were able to remove several references from the derived class because we can now use the inherited methods from the base class. In fact, we gain access to many more methods from the base class, which can be applied to expanding LED by invoking them directly, without the need to relay to an encapsulated Oval object.</div>
