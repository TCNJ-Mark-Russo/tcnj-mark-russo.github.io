<div class="para">An attempt to instantiate Shape will end with a compiler error, and that’s a good thing. After all, Shape is an <em class="emphasis">abstract</em> concept, not an actual graphic. It has no visual representation. The Shape class exists primarily as a way to generalize the concept of a shape and to encapsulate the shared functionality of all concrete shape-derived classes in one place, to avoid the problems associated with code duplication. In fact, the Shape class was designed to be abstract. Never was there an intention that concrete Shape objects would be instantiated. This was part of the original design, and we’d like Java to help us enforce that design restriction.</div>
