<div class="para">The former <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">onPressed(…)</code> event handler method is renamed and its parameters were changed to match the signature <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">onMousePressed(double x, double y, int btn)</code> exactly. This is the signature of the base class method, and must be matched in order to replace it with the derived class method. We add the Java compiler directive <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">@Override</code> before the method as a precaution. This directive tells the compiler that we intend to override a base class method with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">onMousePressed(…)</code> method declaration and to please check it. If the method does not override a base class method, then please throw a compiler error. Using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">@Override</code> directive is highly recommended. Without it, a method that does not match a base class method would compile just fine and we’d never know that we made a mistake. Nothing else is required to override the base class method except to define a derived class method with the exact same signature (method name, parameter types, and order).</div>
