<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">algorithm</dfn> is a well defined set of instructions solving a particular kind problem. The study of algorithms is broad, covering a wide range of techniques as well as mathematical analyses that help us compare them from different perpectives, such as how the number of operations and the amount of memory required to execute an algorithm changes with the size of the problem. These comparisons helps us choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem. In this section we will describe two categories of algorithms called <em class="emphasis">sorting</em> and introduce the ways in which that these algorithms are compared.</div>
