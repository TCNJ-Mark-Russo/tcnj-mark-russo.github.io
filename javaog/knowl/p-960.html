<div class="para">As we investigate various algorithms, we will benefit from having one or more metrics with which to compare them. We want these metrics to measure the utilization of scarce resources because this is what limits performance. The two key metrics that we consider are how the utilization of <em class="emphasis">time</em> and the utilization of <em class="emphasis">space</em> (memory) grows as the size of the problem being solved grows. The size of a problem is characterized by the parameter <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> which measures the number of elements to be processed in a problem. For example, <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> might be the number of items to be searched or the number of items to be sorted. We refer to these two metrics as <dfn class="terminology">time complexity</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">space complexity</dfn>, the derivation of which is called <dfn class="terminology">complexity analysis</dfn>.</div>
