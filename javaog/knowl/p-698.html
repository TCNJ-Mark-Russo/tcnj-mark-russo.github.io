<div class="para">We often see these best practices at play when working with commercial software. Companies that produce Java packages tend to use the reversed components of their Internet domain name as their package structure. This helps to make their packages globally unique because only they own their domain name. If you started a consulting company named "Java Maniac" and purchased the domain name <em class="emphasis">javamaniac.com</em>, you might organize your Java classes in a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">com.javamaniac</code> package scheme, and arrange your source code in a "com/javamaniac" subfolder structure. Note how this specifies both the folder named "com" and a further subfolder named "javamaniac" to contain your types. This avoids the name conflict that would occur with types from the Java Charmer company with the domain name "javacharmer.com." They organize their classes in the "com/javacharmer" subfolder structure. When you add the statement <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">import com.javamaniac.*;</code> to your program, the Java compiler will look in "com/javamaniac" to find these compiled files and check that the way you use them match their definitions.</div>
