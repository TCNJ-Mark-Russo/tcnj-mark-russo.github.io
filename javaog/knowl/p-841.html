<div class="para">If there is no intervention on the part of your program, Java will eventually print a trace of the current state of the <dfn class="terminology">call stack</dfn> when the exception object is thrown. The call stack tells us everything that was underway at the time the error was detected. Use the call stack to find the exact file and line that threw the exception. Move down the call stack to see from where in your program the method was invoked. Depending upon the structure of your program, the call stack can be many levels deep. You should be able to trace the error all the way back to the initial trigger. The mistake could be at any level of the call stack. We’ll take a closer look at what the call stack does and how it functions in <a href="section-re-call-stack.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.2: The Call Stack">Section 12.2</a>.</div>
