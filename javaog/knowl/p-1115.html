<div class="para">Most 2-D computer graphics systems implement a form of linear 2-D geometric transformations known as affine transformations, and include operations such as scale, rotate, and translate. This class of transformations provides a way to modify a shape while preserving its essential nature, e.g. points remain points and parallel lines remain parallel. The easiest way to understand how 2-D transformations work in computer graphics is to imagine that each and every object has its own coordinate system. As described in DoodlePad Drawing Model, when a new DoodlePad Shape object is created its coordinate system is defined with its origin in the upper left corner of the Pad window: x-coordinate values increasing from left to right, y-coordinate values increasing from top to bottom, and distances measured in pixels. Geometric transformation operations give you the ability to move and modify the coordinate system of each and every Shape object independently, with respect to a master coordinate system of the Pad window. For example, it is possible to create two Rectangle Shapes, both with their location set to (0, 0), but appearing at different parts of the Pad. If the coordinate system of one Rectangle is translated to another part of the Pad, then the two Rectangle Shapes would not be drawn at the same location in spite of the fact that they had the same x- and y-coordinate values.</div>
